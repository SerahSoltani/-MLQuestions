### **1.What Are the Different Types of Machine Learning?** 

There are three types of machine learning:  
a)Supervised Learning: In supervised machine learning, a model makes predictions or decisions based on past or labeled data. Labeled data refers to sets of data that are given tags or labels,and thus made more meaningful.  
b)Unsupervised Learning:
In unsupervised learning, we don't have labeled data. A model can identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships in the input data.  
c)Reinforcement Learning:
Using reinforcement learning, the model can learn based on the rewards it received for its previous action.
